# Advertisementdetection system using machine learning techniques.

This project revolves around the detection of advertisements using machine learning means, creating a system that can apply these means and the evaluation of that system. 
The motivation behind this system is the turmoil in advertisement deliverance. The use of advertisements to track users as they navigate the internet and data privacy 
concerns that arise because of this. Further research into this space has revealed advertisement blockers use the same technology to completetheir task. New methods of 
completing this task should be developed.

This report describes how this system was designed and how the design will be implemented.The back-end will utilise two main machine learning algorithms, word2vec and 
the inception model. The system will be used through a chrome plugin implemented in JavaScript.The middle layer will then connect these algorithms and front-end.

The final system will be a chrome plugin that highlights advertisements on a website and presents a metric for how sure the system is.
